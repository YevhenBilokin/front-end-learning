        Space is the vast, seemingly endless expanse beyond Earthâ€™s 
        atmosphere. It is a vacuum with no air, where planets, stars, and galaxies exist. 
        Space is home to the Sun, the Moon, and billions of stars. 
        It is incredibly cold and silent, with no oxygen or gravity like on Earth. 
        Humans explore space using telescopes, satellites, and spacecraft. 
        Astronauts travel to space stations to study the universe. 
        The Milky Way is our galaxy, and beyond it, countless other galaxies exist. 
        Space remains one of the greatest mysteries, holding secrets about the origins of the universe and the possibility of life.
